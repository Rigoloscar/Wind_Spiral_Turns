# Wind_Spiral_Turns
Python program to compute various ICAO PANS-OPS (Aircraft operations, ICAO Doc 8168) turn parameters and the wind spiral, with the aim to help aerospace engineering students with the designing of turn operations. 
The program also plots and visually represents the wind spiral alongside the computed parameters.
